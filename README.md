#Regression models on BA, SLG, OBP in relation to runs from 2003-2013
Baseball Reference using LgAvg per 600 PA, so I only used the statistics of players who had 600+ appareances
Histograms of each variable showed a roughly normal distribution
Overall SLG had the highest correlation surprisingly followed by BA and then OBP
